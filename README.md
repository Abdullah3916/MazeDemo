This is a work in progress sample project i made to learn more about Unity Game Engine.
It uses Unity version 2022.3.22f1



This project procedurally generates a maze at the start of each session with a collectible and a player with a random spawn inside the maze.

The maze is made out of mazecells which to define basicaly as some kind of "cubes". 
I also added some kind of painting effect to the cubes when player gets over them  to make some better visuals  .

Goal of the game is to collect all colectibles.

Like i said this  is stil WIP and there is a lot to add and improve.
